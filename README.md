# Soil Texture Classification System 
This soil texture classification categorizes soils based on the proportions of clay, silt, and sand, forming the basis for soil surveys and mapping. The method mainly involves: (1) projecting sample points according to the percentage composition of soil particles, (2) retrieving the grayscale value at the projected location, and (3) performing a hash table lookup to identify the corresponding soil texture type. This approach simplifies traditional vector-based processes and significantly enhances classification efficiency and system reusability.
